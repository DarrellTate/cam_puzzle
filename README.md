## Presentation Proposal
Our final project will be a form of software art utilizing interactivity, self-portrait, glitch, and generative art.

The title of our piece is *Scrambled Self*

The piece is based on the idea that our lives are all put together in an organized fashion but it only takes one event for it to all fall apart. As we work through and reassembe the pieces, we change a little, we grow and potential learn new emotions, skills, and life lessons that allow us to reorganize and become something better.

Our project will start by taking a self-portrait, using a camera, of the user engaging in the art piece. After the image is taken, it will be converted into a puzzle, composed of puzzle pieces, which can either be hand created or created by a randomly selected premade template. The pieces will then be scrambled and it will be the task of the user to put the puzzle back together. Everytime the user moves a piece, the image on the piece will become slightly more distorted, or glitched, meaning that more piece movements result in a glitcher looking image. When the puzzle is complete, a random quote and image will be selected from quotationspage.com and flicker respectively with the option to start again.

** Please change things as you please, such as the art piece name or description of what the piece means. Also feel free to change any aspect of the project as you fill fit.**
