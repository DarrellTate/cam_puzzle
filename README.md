## Presentation Proposal
Our final project will be a form of software art utilizing interactivity, an aspect of glitch art, and < ... >.

The title of our piece is < cam_puzzle >

Our project will start by taking a "self-portrait" of the user engaging in the piece. After the image is taken, it will be converted into puzzle pieces, which can either be hand created or created by a randomly selected template. The pieces will then be scrambled and it will be the task of the user to put the puzzle back together. Everytime the user moves a piece, the image on the piece will become slightly more glitched, meaning that more piece movements result in a glitcher looking image, the more distorted the image will become. If the puzzle is finished << WHAT DO WE DO >>.

# TODO:
- What other aspects of the class could we include within our puzzle?
- What is the name of our artwork?
- What happens when the puzzle is finished?

- Anything else anybody wants to add?
